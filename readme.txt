You can add or update the translation in your language. You can send [gettext PO and MO files](http://codex.wordpress.org/Translating_WordPress) to me so that I can bundle it into the plugin. You can download [the latest POT file from here](http://svn.wp-plugins.org/alo-easymail/trunk/languages/alo-easymail.pot) and existing language files [from here](http://svn.wp-plugins.org/alo-easymail/trunk/languages/).

IMPORTANT NOTE - *Some of the latest WP versions have a known bug in the wp_cron system (a WP bug, not an EasyMail bug). The EasyMail (v.1.7 and newer) properly WORKS on WP 3.0 and 2.9.1. It probably DOESN'T work on WP 2.9 and 2.9.2. (It seems to work with WP 2.8.x series, but I advise to upgrade).
