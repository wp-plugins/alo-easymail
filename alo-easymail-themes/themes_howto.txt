                             NEWSLETTER THEMES
                         =========================



HOW TO CREATE A THEME:
======================

- create an html theme file, called for example: 
  myname_mytheme.html
  
- if you need images for your theme, you have to store them in a 
  folder named as the html theme file, e.g.: 
  /myname_mytheme/

- the "src" attribute of <img> tag must include relative url to images, e.g.:
  <img src="myname_mytheme/image.jpg" />
  the plugin will replace automatically the relative url with the absolute url
  
- to include the newsletter main content you must include the [CONTENT] tag
  into the html theme file

- then, you can use all placeholders available for newsletters
	
- you can look at default themes fo inspiration and samples


	
TIP:
===

- Copy "alo-easymail-themes" folder to your theme directory and edit your themes
  there. Useful to prevent the loss of themes when you upgrade the plugin.

- In Newsletter-> Setting->tab Newsletter you can disable/enable themes, or 
  force a theme as default
